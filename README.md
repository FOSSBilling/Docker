> **Warning**
> FOSSBilling is under active development but is currently very much beta software, there may be stability or security issues and it is not recommended for use in active production environments yet!

**FOSSBilling** is a free open-source, billing and client management solution. Whatever the size of your online services business, whether a startup or established, FOSSBilling can help you to automate your invoicing, incoming payments, and client management and communication.

If you run a web hosting business and are looking for an open-source alternative for billing and client management, then FOSSBilling is the answer. Although it is mostly used as a solution for hosting businesses, there is no reason why you can't use FOSSBilling for any other kind of online business, like digital downloads.

FOSSBilling is designed to be extensible and to integrate easily with your favorite server management software and payment gateways.

ðŸ“¥ This is self-hosted software that is free for anyone to install â€” All you need is some basic knowledge, a web server, running PHP, and a MySQL database. For more details, check the [requirements](#requirements) section.

## Example Usage

### Docker Pull
```sh
docker pull fossbilling/fossbilling
```

### Docker RUN

```sh
docker run -d fossbilling/fossbilling
```
Then, use the web interface on the Container IP to install FOSSBilling.

### Docker RUN: Port Forwarding 

```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 fossbilling/fossbilling
```
Then, use the web interface on the Host IP to install FOSSBilling.

### Using Docker Compose

This is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file. You should change the values to suit your needs:

```docker
version: "3.9"
services:
  fossbilling:
    image: fossbilling/fossbilling
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - fossbilling:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - front-end
      - back-end
    depends_on:
      - mysql

  mysql:
    image: mysql
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: fossbilling
      MYSQL_USER: fossbilling
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: fossbilling
      MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD: '1'
    volumes:
      - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - back-end

volumes:
  fossbilling:
  mysql:

networks:
  front-end: {}
  back-end: {}
```

Then, use the web interface on the Host IP to install FOSSBilling. If you used this example, the database host field in the installer should be filled with `mysql`. Other fields should be self-explanatory.
